This scope of this archetype has been designed so that parts of a mother's pregnancy/labour/delivery record can be reused and transferred to the health record for their newborn. Used within the context of EVALUATION.pregnancy_summary, the content of this archetype describes details about an infant born to the mother. However, if used within the context of EVALUATION.birth_details it usually records details about the individual's own birth.">
